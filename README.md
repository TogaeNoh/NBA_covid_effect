# Does empty stadium affect players?
## Introduction
After Covid hit during 2020 season, no or limited spectators are permitted to see NBA team play sitting in arenas. 
I wondered if an empty home arena can be the reason for mediocer performance at home.
## Analysis Procedure
1. Web scraping
  * From NBA reference website, data was collected for the period from the 15/16 season to the 20/21 season.
  * Each page shows data per month for each season.
  * One table contains match result, date, attendance figures, and venue. [Source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_games-october-2019.html)
2. Cleaning Data.
  * Since data for every months over six season was collected on seperate DataFrame, those were needed to put together in a single DataFrame.
4. Merging and Modifying Data.
5. Plotting Data.
